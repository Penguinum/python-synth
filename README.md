Just a simple test application, not a something serious. Run this on Python 3. Requires Pyaudio, Scipy, NumPy, Pylab and PyQt4.
I took a piece of code there: http://davywybiral.blogspot.ru/2010/09/procedural-music-with-pyaudio-and-numpy.html
This synth reads data from text file. Each string in file should contain note number (first two digits) and duration of sound (another part of string). For example, 198.4 means: "play 8.4 seconds of note with number 19 ".
